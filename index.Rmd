## Project Description 

Happiness is a viral topic in the modern world, as it is ultimately what everyone longs for. However, according to the World Health Organization, 1 in 8 people suffer from mental disorders, and there has been a 25% increase in depression after COVID-19. With this, I am prompted to know more about how happiness has progressed overtime and the factors that influence it. Not only do I hope to explore the effect of sunshine hours, I am also interested in other factors, such as economic status and freedom in a country.


Perhaps, with this report, I hope to provide insights to government policies or personal actions that can help improve the well-being of individuals. Therefore, combining these motivations, I hope to look at happiness from three different aspects, physiological needs (economic status), regional factors (sunshine), and emotional needs (freedom). 


## Research Question 

My question of interest is "Do people get happier overtime? Does economic status, freedom to make life choices, and sunshine hours affect people's happiness?".
