# What Makes You Happier? An Analysis on Income, Sunshine, Freedom, and Time.  

## About the Project

This was completed as a final project for the course "JSC370: Data Science II" at the University of Toronto. 

## Project Description 

Happiness is a viral topic in the modern world, as it is ultimately what everyone longs for. However, according to the World Health Organization, 1 in 8 people suffer from mental disorders, and there has been a 25% increase in depression after COVID-19. With this, I am prompted to know more about how happiness has progressed overtime and the factors that influence it. Not only do I hope to explore the effect of sunshine hours, I am also interested in other factors, such as economic status and freedom in a country.


Perhaps, with this report, I hope to provide insights to government policies or personal actions that can help improve the well-being of individuals. Therefore, combining these motivations, I hope to look at happiness from three different aspects, physiological needs (economic status), regional factors (sunshine), and emotional needs (freedom). 

The main question of interest is "Do people get happier overtime? Does economic status, freedom to make life choices, and sunshine hours affect people's happiness?".
